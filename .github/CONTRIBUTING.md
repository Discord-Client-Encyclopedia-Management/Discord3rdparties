# How to contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

## You know a client or mod that isn't on our list ? 📝

Open a new Github issue or pull request with your suggestion. Ensure 
the issue description accurately point out the name, link, features, 
language and development status of the client or mod if applicable.

Please be aware of the following things when making suggestions:
1. Avoid making duplicate suggestions. *Please* use the GitHub issue search 
   feature to check if your proposition has been mentioned in the past. 
   Duplicate issues are a huge maintenance burden on the limited resources 
   of the project. If it is clear from your report that you would have 
   struggled to find the original, that's ok, but if searching for a selection 
   of words in your issue title would have found the duplicate then the 
   issue will likely be closed extremely abruptly.
2. Make sure that the information you provided is accurate and if the
   project does not says it's archived or discontinued, it will be
   marked as on hiatus. 👍
